# 5-Lamps-3D-models
When completing a weeks work experience at 5 Lamps I created several 3D models and animations using blender.
Once back home I used my knoweldge of blender and 3D printing software to print out all the models I had designed in the week.
From this I learned how to make my models effectively animated as well as how to make a model ready for printing by reducing the number of weak points they have.
